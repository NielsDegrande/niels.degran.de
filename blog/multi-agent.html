        <h2>Spectrum of LLM interaction patterns</h2>
        Multi-agency is the next step in the evolution of large language model interaction patterns.
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Completions/Chats: A single LLM interaction.</li>
            <li>Chains: Multiple LLM interactions in sequence. Steps can involve further LLM calls.</li>
            <li>Constrained Agents:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Not fully autonomous, but capable of partial agency.</li>
              <li>Often acts as a router or dispatcher, triggering one chain from its menu.</li>
              <li>Complex systems may need multiple levels of dispatch. This can be seen as primitive multi-agency.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Autonomous Agent:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A single agent with autonomy.</li>
              <li>The LLM decides when to call which tools, in what order, and when to return.</li>
              <li>Use autonomy only when needed. Defining logical tool sequences often improves quality and guardrail adherence.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Multi-agents: Several (autonomous) agents.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Multi-what?</h2>
        <p>
          A development team can organize their code with an agent abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does that make it a true multi-agent system?
          These agents might run in a single Python process. Inter-agent communication are method calls.
          Effectively, this is object oriented programming, leveraging a framework that introduces an Agent class (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.).
          The latter is a wrapper around an LLM call, with instructions, a set of tools and some state to update across invocations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it can help to break down the problem solving like a human team, I have seen little gain in sophistication.
          The hello-world for multi-agent frameworks is still writing a blog with an editor, researcher, writer and reviser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, if you want to deploy agents in production, I recommend constraining the workflow as much as possible.
          A more straightforward abstraction can be graphs; sub-graphs also function as a form of lightweight multi-agency.
        </p>
        <h2>When to multi-agent?</h2>
        <p>
          True value emerges when agents operate across different companies or teams.
          They run as distinct applications, communicate via an agent protocol, and discover each other's services. Natural language is the common interface.
          An example might be an internal agent delegating research tasks to an external agent e.g., a university, then sharing a summary with stakeholders through a Salesforce provided Slack agent.
