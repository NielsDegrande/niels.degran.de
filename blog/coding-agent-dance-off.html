      <h1>Coding agent dance-off</h1>

        <p>
          Every morning I wake up with the nagging suspicion that I am using the wrong coding agent.
          Until convincing developer-experience benchmarks exist, I rely on a bench of repeatable challenges to gauge each agent's real-world competence and form my own prior.
        </p>
        <h2>Today's challenge</h2>
        <p>
          A migration task moving a React UI from Material UI to Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
          I use <a href="https://github.com/NielsDegrande/ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this UI</a> as a template to build the frontend for AI applications.
          <img class="blog-img spaced" src="../assets/blog/coding-agent-dance-off/baseline.png" alt="Baseline screenshot" />
          If I were to do this, I would:
          <ol>
            <li>Spin up the dev server and capture screenshots of the existing UI. Alternatively, checkout the project twice and run side-by-side.</li>
            <li>Update configuration files and install or remove dependencies.</li>
            <li>Replace MUI components with shadcn/ui primitives, then update all pages.</li>
            <li>Run the application, fix compile/runtime errors, and ensure visual parity or improvement with the original screenshots.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>OpenHands (o3 + Sonnet 3.7)</strong>
          Began with a clear plan and a few clarifying questions.
          Completed the migration, but the resulting interface was very different.
          It decided to test the application and impressively handled navigation and login flows.
          I believe it is a little chatty, as it quickly hit my OpenAI budget limits, after which I continued with Sonnet.
        </p>

        <img class="blog-img spaced" src="../assets/blog/coding-agent-dance-off/openhands_result.png" alt="OpenHands result screenshot" />
        <p>
          <strong>Aider (Sonnet 3.7)</strong>
          Required only a handful of interventions.
          It asked for frequent approvals when adding new files, which I found annoying.
          Ultimately it produced clean Tailwind code and a UI that mostly matched the original design.
        </p>
        <img class="blog-img spaced" src="../assets/blog/coding-agent-dance-off/aider_result.png" alt="Aider result screenshot" />
        <p>
          <strong>Codex (o4-mini)</strong>
          Inspected the codebase and proposed a plan before requesting user verification.
          Entered a cycle of compiling and fixing errors that was hard to follow, leaving me with limited visibility into its internal steps.
          Eventually I intervened myself, and got it to work by installing a few dependencies.
          While it worked, it was visually the worst result.
        </p>
        <img class="blog-img spaced" src="../assets/blog/coding-agent-dance-off/codex_result.png" alt="Codex result screenshot" />
        <p>
          <strong>Cursor (Auto)</strong>
          Worked quickly, but needed explicit prompts to validate its changes.
          Partway through validating, it began re-introducing MUI dependencies, at which point I halted the run.
          I considered intervening more, but that would not be a fair comparison.
          No result; hence, no screenshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>GitHub Copilot Agent Mode (GPT-4o & Sonnet 3.7)</strong>
          Copilot in agent mode currently does not support o3 or o4-mini, unfortunately.
          Using 4o, the agent struggled with understanding shadcn/ui.
          It attempted to fetch external resources with MCP, though without using valid URLs, and failed completely.
          <br>
          A Sonnet-backed run added the shadcn/ui components but left pages unmodified, then finished while overstating its progress.
          No result; hence, no screenshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Others</strong>
          I have not signed up for Zed's agentic beta yet.
          While I see a lot of traction, I have not found the willingness yet to invest in adopting a new IDE.
          <br>
          Claude Code's authentication flow has been letting me down so far, so it is excluded for the time being.
        </p>
        <h2>Ranking</h2>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          I attempted this challenge a few months ago, and now I achieve significantly better results.
          Extrapolating, I can imagine that in a few months, we will have a solid solution that works first-time right.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The importance of the foundation model (FM). For now, I believe the FM is more important than the IDE or framework.</li>
          <li>Coding agents not tied to an IDE seem to perform better for this type of challenge. I gather these are optimized for longer autonomy vs. frequent user interaction.</li>
          <li>A coding agent that validates its own results autonomously is perceived (by me) to perform a lot better. I wonder why these coding agents wait until the end though. I have learned the hard way to test early and often.</li>
          <li>Finding a good UI/UX to get the security vs. autonomy trade-off right. Too many prompts are annoying, while a coding agent being destructive would be very annoying.</li>
