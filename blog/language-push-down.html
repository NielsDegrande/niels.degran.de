        <p>
          Generative engineeringâ€”applying generative AI to software engineeringâ€”has drastically changed the way I develop.
          Now, we incorporate agentic patterns, further pushing the boundaries of the developer experience.
          How will this recent change impact programming language design and adoption?
          As a developer, I foresee changes in the languages we use to write or review code.
          Additionally, I see implications for how we do CI/CD and what we might end up deploying.
        </p>
        <h2>Bear case on frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          This website does not use any framework. No Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll.
          Instead I handcraft every file, like the olden days.
          Why? Originally because it pleased my inner geek.
          Making drastic changes to such a website used to be painful though,
          and often involved searching and replacing throughout the codebase.
          That, to a large extent, has disappeared.
          Now I prompt a change, the agent picks up the relevant files, and applies the change wherever needed.
          I read through the proposed changes in similar fashion as a PR review, make edits or re-prompt where needed.
          As I argued in an earlier post, it is far from perfect, but these new development flows will only get better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it wasteful to use LLMs as a drop-in replacement for static site generators?
          Probably. However it keeps things simple. No node, no nothing.
          It puts me on the sweet spot between complexity (low), flexibility (high), maintainability (now high too).
        </p>
        <h2>Transpilation at development time</h2>
        <p>
          LLM-driven development allows me to code in "lower level" languages or paradigms than I would otherwise do.
          How far can we stretch this?
          I might code an algorithm in Python, ask the agent to write test cases,
          then transpile the algorithm and its test cases to C or Rust.
          The latter is what I end up compiling and deploying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could it ever go as far as writing e.g., CUDA or machine code? What if we have dedicated foundation models?
          Unlikely, as quickly the relative expressiveness of the languages involved might get in the way.
          However, the complexity threshold reduction might fast forward developer tooling,
          making these languages and frameworks more accessible nevertheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution towards lower level languages and frameworks might make DevOps, for example, CI/CD, simpler too.
          For example, deploying this website does not require any tooling beyond FTP sync.
        </p>
        <h2>Closer to the metal</h2>
        <p>
          While the job of a developer might shift towards prompting,
          hence writing more English and less code,
          I am pleased that we might be doing so closer to the metal.
        </p>
        <h2>Postscript</h2>
        <p>
          I wrote this blog while on a plane with no internet access.
          Usually I start from a couple of bullets and have Copilot write a first draft.
          Then there are several iterations of editing and prompting.
          This time I wrote the whole blog in one go, no Copilot
          nor tapping into any of the smaller models I run locally.
          Once on the ground, I asked Copilot to review grammar and style, I got no suggestions.
        </p>
        <cite>
          The style is concise and clear overall. It is professional and direct. -Copilot
        </cite>
        <p>
          Thank you! It is nice to know that I can still write without assistance ðŸ˜¬.
          I wonder how much longer that will be the case.
