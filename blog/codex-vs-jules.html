        <p>
          My post on the spectrum of coding agents is not even cold yet, and already two new names are trending:
          <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/" class="link-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's Codex in the cloud</a> and
          <a href="https://jules.google/" class="link-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Jules</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On paper they feel familiar.
          Picture the terminal-based coding agents but with a web UI glued on top
          and the development environment moved to the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate them fairly, I presented both with the same task:
          migrating SQLAlchemy to SQLModel.
        </p>
        <p>
          My verdict: it does not work.
          Both claimed success, yet neither achieved working static typing (<code>pyright</code>) or passing tests.
          Jules did not even attempt to run any linting or tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the problem lies in their approach to development environments.
          Rather than using a Dockerfile as the environment definition,
          they rely on prompt-based instructions (see <code>AGENTS.md</code>).
          I could envision this working for simple tasks, similar to Sweep's original vision â€”
          I recently discovered they have pivoted to developing coding assistants for JetBrains.
          Their initial concept was to create a junior developer that handles issues and creates pull requests through GitHub integration.
          Skipping the step of defining a development environment does not work for complex tasks yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          One interesting observation: while Jules demonstrated better understanding of SQLModel and thus performed the conversion more effectively,
          it chose to refactor my Python code into something Java-like.
          This was neither requested nor Pythonic.
          Codex, on the other hand, was hallucinating the SQLModel API,
          but at least maintained the original coding style.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am confident both will improve over time,
          but I do not yet see them as a threat to existing coding agents.
          They represent a new (browser-based) interface for coding agents,
          rather than a new class of agents.
          The UI/UX benefits simple issues,
          but requires direct integration with CI to be truly valuable.
          Once they natively integrate with GitHub or your preferred distributed VCS,
          I would certainly consider using this coding agent interface for simple issues (initially).
        </p>
        <h2>Addendum (2025-05-21): GitHub Copilot Coding Agent</h2>
        <p>
          Less than a day has passed, and GitHub has announced its own cloud-based coding agent:
          <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/" class="link-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot Coding Agent</a>.
          In this post, I argued that a cloud-based coding agent should be more closely integrated with the version control system.
          I got what I asked for!
